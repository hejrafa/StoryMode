What they created instead was G'huun: a proto-god of blood and shadow, born in a lab, every safeguard bypassed. Sealed in stasis for millennia, fed by the blood trolls until he was strong enough to break containment himself. Uldir was not a dungeon. It was a prison that had started to answer back.\n\nYou fought through the facility's corrupted wards — past G'huun's lieutenants, through the experiments that had gone wrong in the age before trolls had language — and reached the heart of the prison. G'huun fell. The blood god's thousand-year campaign to break free ended in the same titan vault it began in. Nazmir would take generations to recover. The trolls who had given their lives feeding G'huun would never be fully redeemed. But the earth was quiet again, and the seal held.",
